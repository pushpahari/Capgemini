
LINUX file structure

file structure represents the work flow of the operation system.
in windows it is divided in to drive{like C drive{total information about operators like configuration files excute files,storage file,E drive,F drive(here we can store the data)}

but in linux all files is distrubut like conf ,storage file

/ = parent directory or main directory of all directories in linux
/root = root user home directory { sudo su -} he is also called admin he have full power
/home = user home directory .here information about user{ su -shyam}
/bin = contain all binary files these are executable files.
       this files doesnt reflect the system {ls ,pwd,}
/sbin = it contain executable which will effect the system
         eg ;(useradd)->creating user
/dev = device releated information like hard disks & disks partitions
/etc = all configuration store here
/mnt = mounting points information stored here {labeling for space present in harddisk}
/opt = it is a optional directory {manually download and install application like tar and zip files}
          user can store 3rd party apllication here like maven ,tomcat,nexus
/proc = it contains process information of computer 
/srv = service related information like kernel service eg: kernel
/sys = system information like processor ,ram,hdd ,hardwire
/var = it is variable directory logs,mails,cronjob	{mainly used to check logs}	  
/usr = users applications store here eg: apt install jenkins -y{apt use chesi install chesina application lu ani ekada untai}
/media = like pendrive {removable drivers}
/tmp = storage used to stores temporary


command 
man commandname -->it show information all about command
whoami = it display who login which user login
id = details display by user 
uname -a -->its show kernal version 
uname -m --> it show system articulture
top --> show user login from which time onwards
ifconfig --> it show ip of system
pwd =>present working directory
cd /  =>change directory
ls = to list files
ls -l = long list {here we can see file permission and file size}
ls -lh = it long list human readable lanugage
ls -lr = it show files in reverse order
ls -la = it show hidden files also{like . file
cd bin / = ls | grep "ls"
| = pipe it is a process {{ls} oka  command output works as a input command }
grep = it is filiter ---> ls | grep "a"  {ls use chesi display chesamu files and pipe use chesi a name tho una files ani display chesaru}
head = it will display 1st 10 files { ls /etc/ | head }
tail = it will display last 10 files { ls /etc/ | tail }
history = it show history of all commands { i want just last 10commands = history | head }
less and more same = work same as cat command but while using less page divided into24 lines , f used to next page   , b used to back page,q used to quit}
/wordname used to search

wc = display how many lines in file how many words c,characters{wc filename} {wc -l filename = it shows only lines} {wc -c filename = it show only characters , wc -w it display words}
mkdir = directory create 
touch = file create
rm filename = it will remove file
rm -rf = it will delete containt in files and directory
rm -f filename = force fully delete
rm -rfv = it show sucessfully deleted file
cp sourcepath destpath 
mv sourcepath destpath
cat = used to read file
cat > filename => we can write containt through keyboard need not to go vi editior and nano editior
cat >> filename ==>already una containt ki new containt add avutundi
echo "hello" > filename -->it will create file and copy containt or it can copy exisiting containt also
